      <p>
        The <strong>Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG)</strong> is a small Boston-based team of
        mathematicians launched by
        Moon
        Duchin of Tufts University. Our mission is to study applications of geometry and computing to U.S.
        redistricting.
        We believe that gerrymandering of all kinds is a fundamental threat to our democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goals are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>to <strong>pursue cutting-edge research</strong> in the practically relevant applications of geometry,
          topology, and
          computing
          to the redistricting problem;</li>
        <li>to <strong>foster collaboration</strong> with researchers in statistics, supercomputing, law, political
          science, and other
          fields; </li>
        <li>to <strong>facilitate direct civic engagement</strong> by training scholars from a variety of quantitative
          backgrounds to
          serve as expert witnesses and consultants in redistricting cases;</li>
        <li>to <strong>educate the public</strong>, both through direct outreach and by helping college and high school
          teachers
          incorporate units on voting, gerrymandering, and civil rights into the mathematics curriculum;</li>
        <li>to <strong>build a diverse community</strong> of mathematically inclined people around the country and give
          them the
          knowledge
          and the tools to hold map-drawers accountable when 2020 comes around.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="support">The Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group is a project supported by the Jonathan M. Tisch
        College of Civic Life at Tufts University. Tisch College strives to strengthen civic engagement and political
        learning, and is proud to support the MGGGâ€™s work to solve some of the most pressing problems of democracy.
