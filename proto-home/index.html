      <p>
        The Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG) is a small Boston-based team of mathematicians launched by
        Moon
        Duchin of Tufts University. Our mission is to study applications of geometry and computing to U.S.
        redistricting.
        We believe that gerrymandering of all kinds is a fundamental threat to our democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goals are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>to pursue cutting-edge research in the practically relevant applications of geometry, topology, and
          computing
          to the redistricting problem;</li>
        <li>to foster collaboration with researchers in statistics, supercomputing, law, political science, and other
          fields; </li>
        <li>to facilitate direct civic engagement by training scholars from a variety of quantitative backgrounds to
          serve as expert witnesses and consultants in redistricting cases;</li>
        <li>to educate the public, both through direct outreach and by helping college and high school teachers
          incorporate units on voting, gerrymandering, and civil rights into the mathematics curriculum;</li>
        <li>to build a diverse community of mathematically inclined people around the country and give them the
          knowledge
          and the tools to hold map-drawers accountable when 2020 comes around.</li>
      </ul>
