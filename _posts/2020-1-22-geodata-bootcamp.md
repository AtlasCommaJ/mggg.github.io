The MGGG Redistricting Lab is planning a paid two-week Summer Geodata Bootcamp. Students will learn how to prepare data and create maps for electoral redistricting and to think critically about ongoing debates in the redistricting process. Following completion of the bootcamp, students will also have opportunities to continue working on redistricting projects. 

Application information will be posted in early February.
