Since the founding of MGGG in 2016, we have worked closely with the [Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law](https://www.lawyerscommittee.org/), one of the nation’s premier civil rights organizations, possibly best known for their crucial work protecting vote access for the most vulnerable Americans.  (See [866-OUR-VOTE](https://866ourvote.org/))  In 2020, we are working closely with LCCR’s Redistricting and Voting Rights Policy Specialist Fred McBride on his Participatory Redistricting Program, which draws in students from around the nation to develop the tools and skills to be the next generation of redistricting experts. Fred was a visiting expert in our [Geodata Bootcamp and our Mapping Training](https://sites.tufts.edu/vrdi/geodata-bootcamp-and-mapping-trainings/) in Summer 2020.
