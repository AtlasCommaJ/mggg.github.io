MGGG has organized a collaborative effort of mathematical and legal experts to
file an amicus brief for the upcoming Supreme Court gerrymandering cases. An
amicus brief is a "friend of the court" filing, where outside parties try to
help supply the court with useful information.

## Backstory

The Court
[has clearly asked for](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/585/16-1161/case.pdf)
an account of partisan gerrymandering that is based on harm to _individual_
rights in _specific_ districts. (That is, they are not currently receptive to
arguments about overall statewide balance, and it's not productive to focus on
the abstract theory of representative democracy.) Relying upon and drawing from
the Court’s prior precedents, we first articulated a legal conception of
partisan vote dilution. We then explained why and how a mathematical technique
can help courts identify and reliably prove the legal harm.

Here's how our argument goes:

- Vote dilution is the intentional departure from a baseline of equal treatment
  of voters by the state. Some voters are harmed by having the weight, power,
  and value of their vote intentionally diminished by the government.
- This is unconstitutional, whether it's done on the basis of geography, race,
  sex, or partisanship, and for the same reasons.
- When it comes to population balance, the arithmetic has not been that hard for
  the Court—the baseline is equal population in every district.
- When it comes to partisanship, the neutral baseline is harder to find. But
  there is a reliable, well-developed mathematical technique called
  [MCMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) that's up to
  the job, and that scopes out how districts will tend to divide up a state if
  only the written rules are taking into account, and the voting patterns are
  held constant.
- A district that's an extreme outlier is probably a gerrymander!

For instance, here are plots showing two North Carolina districts from the
Legislature's 2016 Plan. The bell curves are histograms of a million plans
sampled by MCMC.

(2012 Plan and 2016 Plan were proposed and enacted by the NC Legislature. The
[Judges' Plan](https://sanford.duke.edu/articles/nonpartisan-redistricting-panel-reveals-unofficial-nc-congressional-voting-map),
by contrast, was made by a bipartisan panel of retired judges.) In the 2012 and
2016 Plans, Democrats are "packed" or overstuffed into the right-hand district
and "cracked" or dispersed out of the left-hand district.

Both enacted plans have districts so far outside the curve they look like they
don't even belong to the same universe of possibilities. We argue that this is
better explained by partisan intent—getting a solid R district instead of two
likely D districts—than by the rules and political geography of the state. We
were able to replicate the outlier findings of the plaintiff's expert very
closely, even though we used a totally different MCMC technique.
