Colleges can provide much-needed support for strained hospitals.  As the growing number of coronavirus cases continues to strain limited hospital resources, college campuses with largely vacated dormitories are in a unique position to provide additional beds and facilities to hospitals. Dorms can be repurposed as alternative hospital sites to house recovering patients and offer temporary lodging to medical personnel, coordinated through health care providers.
