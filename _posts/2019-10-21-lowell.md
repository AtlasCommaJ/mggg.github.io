Two years ago, the City of Lowell was sued because its system of election prevented minority communities from being represented in city government. For example, even though there are 9 members of the City Council—and nearly half of Lowell’s population is Asian or Hispanic—there have only been 2 people of color elected to the City Council in 20 years!

We have two reports, which you can download here:
* [Community-Centered Redistricting in Lowell, Massachusetts](/Lowell-Report), is an introduction to ranked choice voting (RCV) and districts and the choice on the ballot in November.
* [Findings on the City of Lowell’s Election Systems](/Lowell-Detailed-Report) is a more detailed report covering our findings on the situation in Lowell.


## Draw your own districts

To accompany this report, we have added Lowell to
[Districtr](https://districtr.org), our open-source web app for redistricting so
that anyone can try their hand at drawing a districting plan and to explore the
interplay between the structure of a districting system and the demographics of
individual districts.
