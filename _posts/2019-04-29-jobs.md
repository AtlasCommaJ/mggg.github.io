The Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG) is a research organization
based at Tufts and MIT studying applications of geometry and computing to U.S.
redistricting. Our mission is both technical and civic, and we aim to drive
cutting-edge research, amplify the voices of the public and the civil rights
community, and improve accountability in the redistricting process.

As of February 2021, we are currently looking for a **[Software Developer](#software-developer)**.
Letters of interest are being accepted
by email to [jobs@mggg.org](mailto:jobs@mggg.org). Please include a CV with
links to relevant projects, with your GitHub username if applicable. 

Access to voting rights for communities of color and other marginalized groups
is central to our mission, and we strive to build a team that is diverse in as
many ways as possible.
