The recent wave of attention to partisan gerrymandering has come with a push to
refine or replace the laws that govern political redistricting around the
country. A common element in several states’ reform efforts has been the
inclusion of *competitiveness metrics*, or scores that evaluate a districting
plan based on the extent to which district-level outcomes are in play or are
likely to be closely contested.

In this paper, we examine several classes of competitiveness metrics motivated
by recent reform proposals and then evaluate their potential outcomes across
large ensembles of districting plans at the Congressional and state Senate
levels. This is part of a growing literature using MCMC techniques from applied
statistics to situate plans and criteria in the context of valid redistricting
alternatives. Our empirical analysis focuses on five states—Utah, Georgia,
Wisconsin, Virginia, and Massachusetts—chosen to represent a range of partisan
attributes. We study the feasibility and the partisan consequences of adopting
and tightening various kinds of competitiveness requirements. We show that
optimizing for competitiveness some- times pulls partisan metrics to one side of
their neutral baseline. These results highlight the importance of investigating
possible new rules with careful mathematical modeling on real geospatial data
to look for unintended consequences and for tensions with other redistricting
goals.
