We consider the measures of partisan symmetry proposed for practical use in the political science literature, as clarified and developed in Katz-King-Rosenblatt. Elementary mathematical manipulation shows the symmetry metrics derived from uniform partisan swing to have surprising properties. To accompany the general analysis, we study measures of partisan symmetry with respect to recent voting patterns in Utah, Texas, and North Carolina, flagging problems in each case. Taken together, these observations should raise major concerns about using quantitative scores of partisan symmetry -- including the mean-median score, the partisan bias score, and the more general "partisan symmetry standard" -- as the decennial redistricting approaches.
