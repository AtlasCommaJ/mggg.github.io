[Common Cause](https://www.commoncause.org/), a nonprofit good-government organization championing voting rights and redistricting reform, has partnered with MGGG’s [Districtr](http://districtr.org) development team to co-create an updated train-the-trainer curriculum for community data collection. Some states and cities have redistricting guidance that calls for official consideration of “communities of interest,” but very few states have a public submission mechanism that allows the line-drawers to see the community input while they make the new maps. Districtr helps to close that gap by letting community members pick up the pen and tell lawmakers what matters to them.
