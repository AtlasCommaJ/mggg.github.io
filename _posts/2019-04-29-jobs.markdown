The Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG) is a research organization
based at Tufts and MIT studying applications of geometry and computing to U.S.
redistricting. Our mission is both technical and civic, and we aim to drive
cutting-edge research, amplify the voices of the public and the civil rights
community, and improve accountability in the redistricting process.

We will soon begin hiring for several positions (**[Geographer](#geographer)**,
**[Software Developer](#software-developer)**, and
**[Data Scientist](#data-scientist)**) through the Tisch College of Civic Life
at Tufts University. Letters of interest are being accepted until the end of May, 
by email to [jobs@mggg.org](mailto:jobs@mggg.org). Please include a CV with
links to relevant projects, with your GitHub username if applicable. If you see
yourself as falling in between these job titles, tell us so. We hope for start dates
in Summer 2019, with opportunities for engagement with the
[Voting Rights Data Institute](http://gerrydata.org).

Access to voting rights for communities of color and other marginalized groups
is central to our mission, and we strive to build a team that is diverse in as
many ways as possible.
