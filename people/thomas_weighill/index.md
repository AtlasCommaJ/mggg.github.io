In January 2021 I will be joining the University of North Carolina at Greensboro as an Assistant Professor.

### Research interests

My research is in geometry and topology and their applications to data science. My pure mathematics research is mostly in the field of coarse geometry -- the study of large scale properties of metric spaces -- which has strong mathematical connections to geometric group theory, functional analysis and the topology of manifolds. My more applied research focuses on topological data analysis (TDA), optimal transport and mathematical approaches to data science in general. I am particularly interested in applications to geospatial data analysis, redistricting and election reform.


### Teaching information

At Tufts University I taught Point-Set Topology in Spring 2020 and am currently teaching a course on Topological Data Analysis. At the University of Tennessee I was a GTA for College Algebra, Basic Calculus and Matrix Algebra.
