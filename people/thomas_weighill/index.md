In January 2021 I will be joining the University of North Carolina at Greensboro as an Assistant Professor.

### Research interests

My research is in geometry and topology and their applications to data science. My theoretical work in mathematics is mostly in the field of coarse geometry -- the study of large scale properties of metric spaces -- which has strong mathematical connections to geometric group theory, functional analysis and the topology of manifolds. A major theme in coarse geometry is to discover the shape of discrete spaces. This, along with my multidisciplinary background in mathematics, engineering and data science, led me to become interested in the shape of data, specifically in topological data analysis and computational geometry. I am particularly interested in data science research into redistricting, elections and civil rights.


### Teaching information

At the University of Tennessee I was a GTA for College Algebra, Basic Calculus and Matrix Algebra. At Tufts University I taught Point-Set Topology in Spring 2020 and am currently teaching a course on Topological Data Analysis.
