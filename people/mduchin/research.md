### Other Research Activity

* I hosted a 10-person [Research cluster on Rational Billiards](http://sites.tufts.edu/billiardscluster) at Tufts in Summer 2017. There was a similar cluster in Summer 2014 on the topic of Random Groups.
* I ran the [Undergraduate Faculty Program](https://mduchin.math.tufts.edu/UFP/) at [PCMI 2012](http://pcmi.ias.edu/). This was a Research Lab in geometric group theory for 16 college professors.
* Principal investigator for NSF grant DMS-0906086, Metric geometry of groups and surfaces, 2009-2012, DMS-1207106, Finer coarse geometry, 2012-2015, and DMS-1255442, CAREER: Finer coarse geometry, 2013-2018.
