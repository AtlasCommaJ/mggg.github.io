### Other

* The [Poincaré Institute](http://sites.tufts.edu/poincare/), an educational initiative at Tufts that I worked with in 2011-12.
* Math camps visited in Summer 2011: [HCSSiM](http://www.hcssim.org/), where I gave a talk about geometrical paradoxes; [Canada/USA Mathcamp](http://www.mathcamp.org/), where I gave a short course on the Gauss circle problem; and the brand-new [Summer Program in Mathematical Problem Solving](http://spmps.weebly.com/), which I was just scoping out but hope to be involved with in the future. These are all great programs... check them out!
* Archived teaching evaluation pages from the University of Chicago ([Topics](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~mduchin/evals/112.htm) / [Calc I](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~mduchin/evals/151.htm) / [Calc II](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~mduchin/evals/152.htm))
* "The curve complex and its relatives" ([video](http://www.msri.org/web/msri/online-videos/-/video/showStream/12504/popup)), an expository lecture targeted for advanced graduate students from August 2007 [Connections for Women workshop](https://mduchin.math.tufts.edu/UCD/conn.html) (Teichmuller theory and Kleinian groups program) at MSRI, co-organized with [Caroline Series](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/Caroline_Series/).
* [Collegiate Scholars Program](http://collegiatescholars.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago, a great program for Chicago Public Schools kids, giving them background, community, and encouragement to aim high for college. I taught weekend math courses for CSP in 2004--05.
* [Polk Bros./U Chicago](http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/021107/math.shtml) program for inservice teacher training. ([Another article](http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/070510/skills.shtml).) I visited 1st-8th grade classrooms at three South Side schools on a biweekly basis to work with teachers on "open-ended" math teaching in 2000-2002.
