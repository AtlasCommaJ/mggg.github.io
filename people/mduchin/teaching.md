### Other

* I'm a huge fan of [Canada/USA Mathcamp](http://www.mathcamp.org/) for super smart high school students, where I used to visit and teach every summer before I started
running my own summer programs more regularly.  It has spun off the truly excellent 
[Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics](http://beamath.org/) program, which is focused on cultivating talent in younger
kids in New York and L.A.  These programs are really worthy of your support!
* Archived teaching evaluation pages from the University of Chicago ([Topics](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~mduchin/evals/112.htm) / [Calc I](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~mduchin/evals/151.htm) / [Calc II](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~mduchin/evals/152.htm))
* "The curve complex and its relatives" ([video](http://www.msri.org/web/msri/online-videos/-/video/showStream/12504/popup)), an expository lecture targeted for advanced graduate students from August 2007.
