      <h1>About MGGG</h1>
      <p>
        The <strong>Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG)</strong> is a Boston-based
        working
        group led by Moon Duchin of Tufts University and Justin Solomon of MIT.
        Our mission is to study applications of geometry and computing to U.S. redistricting.
        We believe that gerrymandering of all kinds is a fundamental threat to our democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goals are these:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>to pursue cutting-edge <strong>research</strong> in the basic science and
          practically relevant applications of geometry,
          topology, and computing to the redistricting problem;</li>
        <li>to build open-source <strong>tools and resources</strong> that create public access and
          analytical power
          for better understanding districts and their consequences;</li>
        <li>to partner with <strong>civil rights</strong> organizations to reexamine and strengthen
          the
          quantitative toolkit for protecting voting rights;</li>
        <li>to offer formal and informal expert <strong>consulting</strong> to stakeholders on all
          sides.</li>
      </ul>
