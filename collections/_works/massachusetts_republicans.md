description:
  We argue that the underperformance of Republicans in Massachusetts is not
  attributable to gerrymandering, nor to the failure of Republicans to field House
  candidates, but is a structural mathematical feature of the distribution of votes.
  For several of the elections studied here, there are more ways of building a valid
  districting plan than there are particles in the galaxy, and every one of them will
  produce a 9-0 Democratic delegation.
