description: At the time of writing, Virginia is in the process of replacing its House
  of Delegates districting plan after eleven of the districts were ruled unconstitutional
  by a District Court in June 2018. This report presents a large ensemble of alternative
  valid districting plans, which we propose to use as a baseline for comparison in
  the evaluation of newly proposed plans. Our method highlights and quantifies the
  dilutive effects of packing Black Voting Age Population. This is a novel application
  to racial gerrymandering of industry-standard techniques from statistics and computational
  science.
