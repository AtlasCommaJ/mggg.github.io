    <h1>Our Team</h1>
    <p>
        As an organization, MGGG operates on multiple scales. We have a core
        group in the Boston area, a larger group of active contributors working
        with us on various projects, and several hundred people who attended our
        cycle of training sessions around the country in 2017-18, including
        dozens who are preparing to serve as expert witnesses and consultants.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the largest level of zoom, 1,932 people from a range of specialized
        backgrounds had filled out our
        <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kHmDliQ9o7BMxx6W2"
            >Skills and Interests Inventory</a
        >
        as of Oct 1, 2018 to be part of our global network of collaborators on
        call. This represents a very wide range of talent, from statistics to
        critical race theory to mobile app development. If your organization
        needs technical expertise in the voting rights sphere, please reach out
        to us for contacts and support at
