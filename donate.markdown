# Support

The Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG) will use donations to support its multidisciplinary work on geometric aspects of redistricting.

{% include donate_button.html %}

MGGG is based at Tufts and so our fundraising goes through the university. The link above will take you to the standard Tufts donation page, with "Geometry of Redistricting" pre-selected as the area of giving. Donations are tax-deductible, and the university takes no overhead: **every dollar goes directly to MGGG**. Please feel free to ignore the Tufts-specific questions.

## The small print

Funding will be used for ongoing activities of the MGGG, which may include the following.

- **Research:** Design and study of mathematical methodologies that can distinguish between gerrymandered and non-gerrymandered districts; statistical evaluation of models used to analyze existing and proposed districts; design of algorithms and software to visualize and quantify effects of gerrymandering; supplies and equipment for the above.
- **Outreach:** Travel associated with speaking engagements on MGGG research projects and apportionment/redistricting more generally; generation and dissemination of K-12 and undergraduate educational materials related to the mathematical, political, and social implications of gerrymandering.
- **Events:** Conferences and gatherings to promote research and public awareness of mathematical aspects of redistricting, including informational materials for attendees, honoraria for speakers, and expenses of invited participants.
- **Consulting:** Expert witnessing, scientific/GIS-based evidence collection, and other activities to support legal cases and civic projects for which the geometry of gerrymandering may be relevant.

The MGGG is a non-partisan group dedicated to promoting fair electoral practices. While we may participate in cases brought or defended by partisan entities, donations will support the activities proposed above and should not be understood as aligning with a particular political party, cause, or organization.
