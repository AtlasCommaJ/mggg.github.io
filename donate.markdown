# Support

The Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG) Redistricting Lab will use donations to support its multidisciplinary projects on the mathematics and data science of redistricting, voting rights, and census geography.

{% include donate_button.html %}

MGGG is based at Tufts and so our fundraising goes through the university. The link above will take you to the standard Tufts donation page, with “Geometry of Redistricting” pre-selected as the area of giving. Donations are tax-deductible, and the university takes no overhead: **every dollar goes directly to MGGG**. (Tufts-specific questions are optional.)


## The small print

Funding will be used for ongoing activities of MGGG, which may include the following.

- **Research:** Design and study of mathematical methodologies for the study of census, elections, and redistricting; statistical evaluation of models used for these applications; design of algorithms and software to visualize and quantify demographic and electoral data; supplies and equipment for the above.
- **Outreach:** Travel associated with speaking engagements on MGGG research projects and apportionment/redistricting more generally; generation and dissemination of K-12 and undergraduate educational materials related to the mathematical, political, and social implications of our research.
- **Events:** Conferences and gatherings to promote research and public awareness of election science, including informational materials for attendees, honoraria for speakers, and expenses of invited participants.
<!-- - **Consulting:** Expert witnessing, scientific/GIS-based evidence collection, and other activities to support legal cases and civic projects for which the geometry of gerrymandering may be relevant. -->

The MGGG Redistricting Lab is a non-partisan research group. We are dedicated to promoting fair electoral practices. Our research should not be understood as aligning with a particular political party, cause, or organization.

## Funding Disclosure

Beyond individual donations, the Lab raises substantial amounts of money for our staff salaries and our outreach and training programs. We proactively choose to be transparent about our principles for funding. 

We only seek or accept funding from organizations or individuals whose public positions are consistent with our Lab’s mission and programmatic priorities, which are rooted in scientific inquiry and the steadfast pursuit of civil rights in the broadest sense. Our agreements are always based on rigorous data-driven inquiry and maximum transparency. We have settled on a policy against accepting funding from explicitly partisan organizations. Individuals in the Lab may engage in consulting projects (subject to Tufts conflict of interest policies), but the Lab itself is oriented to open-ended research.

Our commitments:  Any funded work prepared by the Lab will be made publicly available.  We use public tools, code, and data whenever possible, and we disclose the sources of data when it has been prepared by a third party. We strive to use our expertise to represent data clearly, providing appropriate context and sources of error. We do not use data practices that we believe to be misleading, even if they are common practice among election data practitioners.

Our biggest single funding source is the National Science Foundation. Below is a complete list of foundations or organizations that have been sponsors of grants or contracts since the Lab was founded at Tisch College in 2018.

The MGGG Redistricting Lab has been part of the [Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life](https://tischcollege.tufts.edu/) since 2018.  Tisch provides an institutional home for the lab, including salary support, student research placements, and office space in Barnum Hall at Tufts University. Tufts is unique in having a civic research hub as a major division of the university, and we are proud to be one of three major labs—together with IDHE and Circle—that anchor that research effort.
