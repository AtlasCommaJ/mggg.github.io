# Our Mission

## Bringing clarity to the redistricting conversation.

We inform the public about redistricting and the mathematics of gerrymandering
through talks, survey articles, interactives, and art.

- Olivia's comic about gerrymandering
- Scientific American piece
- Gridlandia
- Video of a talk

## Building open-source tools to fight gerrymandering.

We are creating the software and the technical infrastructure needed to uncover
gerrymanders and amplify the voices of regular citizens in the redistricting
process.

- **GerryChain**: The open-source framework for redistricting research and
  ensemble analysis.
- **Districtr**: The open web app that empowers all people to draw districting
  plans.
- [Maup: The geospatial toolkit for redistricting data.] (Maybe in the future)

## Working to make redistricting data open and transparent.

We are excavating and cleaning the vital data that we need to ensure that our
districts and elections are fair and free. We are building a pipeline for
redistricting data in preparation for 2020.

- [**mggg-states**](https://github.com/mggg-states): Our growing collection of
  shapefiles, joined with demographic and election data and given a data quality
  grade by our GIS experts.
- **Ohio Precincts Shapefile**: A team at our 2018 Voting Rights Data Institute
  spent over 500 person-hours calling counties, repairing shapefiles, and
  digitizing paper maps to create the first-ever shapefile of Ohio's precincts.

## Fostering an ecosystem of redistricting research.

Computational redistricting is _not_ a solved problem. We are cultivating a
national network of researchers and experts by hosting workshops and
conferences. We are training the next generation of redistricting researchers
through our annual [Voting Rights Data Institute](http://gerrydata.org) for
undergraduates and graduate students.

## Weighing in on redistricting cases.

In our amicus briefs, consulting, and reports we use ensemble analysis to
provide quantitative evidence that is both mathematically sound and sensitive to
the social, political, and geographic context. [We collaborate with civil rights
groups and other key stakeholders. Something about making sure that the
mathematical community plays a responsible role.] (Maybe those should be in
their own subheading?)
