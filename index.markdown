<h1>Our Mission</h1>

The **Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG)** is a Boston-based
working group led by Moon Duchin of Tufts University and Justin Solomon of MIT.
Our mission is to study applications of geometry and computing to U.S.
redistricting. We believe that gerrymandering of all kinds is a fundamental
threat to our democracy.

Our goals are these:

- to pursue cutting-edge **research** in the basic science and practically
  relevant applications of geometry, topology, and computing to the
  redistricting problem;
- to build open-source **tools and resources** that create public access and
  analytical power for better understanding districts and their consequences;
- to partner with **civil rights** organizations to reexamine and strengthen the
  quantitative toolkit for protecting voting rights;
- to offer formal and informal expert **consulting** to stakeholders on all
  sides.
