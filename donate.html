    <h3>The Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG) will use donations to support its
      multidisciplinary work
      on geometric aspects of redistricting.</h3>

        <h3>Donate to MGGG!</h3>
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>MGGG is based at Tufts and so our fundraising goes through the university. The link above
      will take
      you to the
      standard Tufts donation page, with "Geometry of Redistricting" pre-selected as the area of
      giving.
      Donations
      are tax-deductible, and the university takes no overhead: <strong>every dollar goes directly
        to
        MGGG</strong>.
      Please ignore the Tufts-specific questions.</p>

    <h3>The small print</h3>
    <p>Funding will be used for ongoing activities of the MGGG, which may
      include
      the
      following.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Research:</strong> Design and study of mathematical methodologies that can
        distinguish
        between
        gerrymandered and non-gerrymandered districts; statistical evaluation of models used to
        analyze
        existing and
        proposed districts; design of algorithms and software to visualize and quantify effects of
        gerrymandering;
        supplies and equipment for the above.</li>
      <li><strong>Outreach:</strong> Travel associated with speaking engagements on MGGG research
        projects and
        apportionment/redistricting more generally; generation and dissemination of K-12 and
        undergraduate
        educational materials related to the mathematical, political, and social implications of
        gerrymandering.</li>
      <li><strong>Events:</strong> Conferences and gatherings to promote research and public
        awareness of
        mathematical aspects of redistricting, including informational materials for attendees,
        honoraria for
        speakers, and expenses of invited participants.</li>
      <li><strong>Consulting:</strong> Expert witnessing, scientific/GIS-based evidence collection,
        and
        other
        activities to support legal cases and civic projects for which the geometry of
        gerrymandering
        may be
        relevant.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="support">The MGGG is a non-partisan group dedicated to promoting fair electoral
      practices. While
      we may
      participate
      in cases brought or defended by partisan entities, donations will support the activities
      proposed above and
      should not be understood as aligning with a particular political party, cause, or
      organization.</p>
