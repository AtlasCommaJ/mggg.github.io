      <h3>The Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG) will use donations to support its
        multidisciplinary work
        on geometric aspects of redistricting.</h3>

          <h3>Donate to MGGG!</h3>

      <p>MGGG is based at Tufts and so our fundraising goes through the university. The link above will take
        you to the
        standard Tufts donation page, with "Geometry of Redistricting" pre-selected as the area of giving.
        Donations
        are tax-deductible, and the university takes no overhead: <strong>every dollar goes directly to
          MGGG</strong>.
        Please ignore the Tufts-specific questions.</p>

      <p><em>The small print:</em> Funding will be used for ongoing activities of the MGGG, which may include
        the
        following.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Research:</strong> Design and study of mathematical methodologies that can distinguish
          between
          gerrymandered and non-gerrymandered districts; statistical evaluation of models used to analyze
          existing and
          proposed districts; design of algorithms and software to visualize and quantify effects of
          gerrymandering;
          supplies and equipment for the above.</li>
        <li><strong>Outreach:</strong> Travel associated with speaking engagements on MGGG research
          projects and
          apportionment/redistricting more generally; generation and dissemination of K-12 and
          undergraduate
          educational materials related to the mathematical, political, and social implications of
          gerrymandering.</li>
        <li><strong>Events:</strong> Conferences and gatherings to promote research and public awareness of
          mathematical aspects of redistricting, including informational materials for attendees,
          honoraria for
          speakers, and expenses of invited participants.</li>
        <li><strong>Consulting:</strong> Expert witnessing, scientific/GIS-based evidence collection, and
          other
          activities to support legal cases and civic projects for which the geometry of gerrymandering
          may be
          relevant.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>The MGGG is a non-partisan group dedicated to promoting fair electoral practices. While we may
          participate
          in cases brought or defended by partisan entities, donations will support the activities
          proposed above and
          should not be understood as aligning with a particular political party, cause, or organization.</em></p>
